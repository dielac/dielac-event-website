# Event Center - Ladies Night Website

## Hi everyone!!!

Welcome to the **Event Center** website! This is the place for all things related to our fabulous "Ladies Night" event. We've put together a fun, interactive site to give you all the details about the event, from the schedule to how to sign up. The website is designed with a cute, pink aesthetic (because why not? ... and because pink is my favorite color), and it's built using **Bootstrap**, **JavaScript**, and some **CSS** to give it that stylish, modern touch.




## What’s Inside The Website?


Here’s what this website is all about:

1. **Technologies Used**: All the tools that make this website work and be all put together.
2. **Features**: The cool things you’ll see and interact with.
3. **File Structure**: How everything is set up behind the scenes.
4. **Setup and Installation**: How to get this site running on your own machine (you don't have to).
5. **Usage**: What you can do on the site.



## What We Used to Build This


- **HTML**: The foundation of the site. We use HTML to structure the content, like the navigation bar, the footer, and the event cards. *(I'm trying to also include a slideshow of images if I get it to work.)*
- **CSS**: This is where we made things pretty. Our custom CSS gives the site that light pink background and hot pink buttons. I'm all about the pink color and vibes.
- **JavaScript**: Handles all the cool interactive stuff like the event schedule and validating the sign-up form. It makes everything come to life!
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap makes sure the site looks great on every device. It's all about the responsive design so that your experience is smooth even if you’re on a phone or desktop.



## Features

### 1. Responsive Layout
This site is mobile-friendly! Because of **Bootstrap**, it automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, so you can check out the event details anywhere on your phone, tablet, or desktop.

### 2. Event Cards
We’ve got interactive event cards! They show you all the exciting things going on, like **Live Music**, **Food**, **Art**, and **Dancing**. Each card has a "Learn More" link that’ll give you more details about the event.

### 3. Event Schedule
A table dynamically shows the schedule for the **Ladies Night** event. We’ve got everything from the event time to the location, all pulled from JavaScript.

### 4. Sign-Up Form
Ready to join the fun? You can sign up for the event through a simple form. Just pop in your **Name**, **Email**, and **Username**, and you’re good to go! I also used JavaScript to make sure your email is valid before you submit.

### 5. Interactive Buttons
The buttons are cute and hot pink (again, the pink theme!). When you hover over them, they change to an even darker pink, giving you some fun interactivity & adding the hovering effect like we did in the last event website project.

### 6. Fixed Footer
At the bottom of every page, you'll see a fixed footer with a cute pink background. It holds the copyright message, so you know who’s behind this fun website.
