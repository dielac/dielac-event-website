Hello thank you so much for looking through my project, 
Starting off with the Index page
    I really got into and learned how to create a Div, P's, and adding images into this project on this page, i learned how to put the images on a little differently then the teacher because I was watching a recording of a class and could not ask questions so i just ended re searching and another way I found to do it was quite simple as well. So you just right click and save the image onto your desktop then drag the image onto a folder called "public" then link it into your website that way. This was worked for me and stuck in my head the easiest. 
Next, going onto the menu page
     I had a bit of difficulty on this page but im very thankfully to the staff. They helped me figure out how to do it and I created a table of the menu, then creating little "TH" lists of what i was listing for the menu, marking it that so I can also change it in css to however or whatever I wanted.
     I used the same nav bar set up on all pages and thankfully it worked really well and connected to all pages and changed throughout the screensizes.
Next for the location,
    I sourced the google map through a 'iframe' that linked my map onto the page, once i did that i changed the height, width, and other measurements of the mao to work and look how i wanted it to.
    after i used mulitple divs to create little sentances for me to explain the location and some nearby landmarks by the location. 
Next on the Events page,
    On this page i soruced the imaged by saving them onto my desktop and dragging them into the publics folder, than after creating lines of 'p's so that i could make a couple of sentances of information about the events, then i labeled them all so that in the CSS folder i could create a boarder around the events and make the look nice. Also just like the home page I also used a gridbox & flexbox example.
Next on the Contact Us page,
    For this page I used the same Nav bar as the rest of the pages and it looked and worked the best for my website. I used divs to create a list of information about how to contact. My last few divs i labeled a 'container' so that in CSS i was able to add onto the styling of the page but only effect what was in that container. I also put it into a form, so that it coulf create a form for me and used<button> as well to create a button and labeling it so that it would read 'submit now'. Then closing them off with their closing labels to finish off the code, as i did on every other page as well.
The about page,
    For this page i wanted to use the hover effect on the contact button, and created a button so that underneath my explaination about the "Ceos" in charge there were more codes added onto the page instead of doing just a small about me section on the home page. I used Collumns, Cards, and Containers to apply to where i wanted everything to be and how i wanted them labeled so that in CSS i could style them how I wanted. I also created a button underneath the information and created a hover effect once you scroll over the button. 
CSS,
    for the css page i did alot of .button or .container(example) for how i labeled things in other pages so that it would effect my styling of specific things once i make them different from the rest, using text-allign, colors, boarders, the hover effect, or something as small as changing the sizing of things. This page did the most for making my website look appealing and making stubborn headers, maps, etc do what they needed to do.
