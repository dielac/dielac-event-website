<main></main>
    I used this tag to show what the following information was holding, like a title.

<!--></!-->
    I used these tags to create comments throughout my codes. These do not show up on the website.

<div></div>
    I used <div> as a container to organize what i was putting together, whatever you put in a div will apprear onto your website seperatly than the others if closed off.

<p></p>
    This tag stands for paragraph, whatever is put in this tag will stand on its own on the website as its own sentance/paragraph. I mainly used it for little sentances.


<html></html>
    I used <html> to start my document, it is a container for the rest of the codes and the start and end of every page should have the <html> tag to close off the container.

 <li> </Li>
 I used lists to list various things and to allign them how I wanted.

<nav></nav>
    I used Nav to define navigation links, specificlly here out table of contents

<header></header>
    The header is a semantic tag, I used it for the main heading and as a container for my site logo.

<a></a>
     <a> is an anchor tag which I used to link url's throughout my project, also links emails, files, etc. 

  
    I really got into and learned how to create a Div, P's, and adding images into this project on this page, I learned how to put the images on a little differently. I right click and save the image onto my desktop then drag the image onto a folder I created called "public" then link it into your website that way. This was worked for me and stuck in my head the easiest. The rest of the tags I have used on this page are explained above. 


Menu:
<table border="1">
	 <tr>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	</tr>
	 <tr>
	</tr>
</table>
Creating this page I used tabels and "th" (table header) to create the menu, and "tr" to create the rows, adding the <table boarder="1"> ensures a border as well, keeping everything listed seperate.

<li> </Li>
  I used lists to list various things and to allign them how I wanted.

    I created a table of the menu, then creating little "TH" lists of what iI was listing for the menu, marking it that so I can also change it in css to however or whatever I wanted.
     I used the same nav bar set up on all pages, the rest of the tags I used are listed above.

    For this page I used the same Nav bar as the rest of the pages and it worked the best for my website. I used divs to create a list of information about how to contact. My last few divs I labeled a 'container' so that in CSS I was able to add onto the styling of the page but only effect what was in that container. I also put it into a form, so that it could create a form and I used the <button> tag as well to create a button and labeling it so that it would read 'submit now'. Then closing them off with their closing labels to finish off the code, as I did on every other page as well. Other tags and why I used them are above.

<!--></!-->
    I used these tags to create comments throughout my codes. These do not show up on the website.


    For this page I wanted to use the hover effect on the contact button, and created a button so that underneath my explaination about the "Ceos" in charge there were more codes added onto the page instead of doing just a small about me section on the home page. I used Collumns, Cards, and Containers to apply to where I wanted everything to be and how I wanted them labeled so that in CSS I could style them how I wanted. I also created a button underneath the information and created a hover effect once you scroll over the button. Other tags and containers I used on this page and why are listed above.
CSS,
body {
    background-color: rgb(245, 218, 182);
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    color: black;
    margin: 0rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    height: 100vh;
}
    This is one example of my styles.css, is the bosy, here in the body I used it to change the main background-color, change the font, color,display,how to column everything and even change the height of it.

Width;
    Changed how wide an image or text or banner is.
Height;
    Changes the height of an image,text,banner,etc.

Text-allign;
    Changes how the text or image is places, EX; Center.

Display;
    Changes how a text, or image, etc is displayed. EX; Grid.

Padding;
    Padding adds a bit of space in between things such as images.

Border-radius;
    Border changes the edges or created edges on the styles sheet or round corners on buttons or images. 

margin-top;
    Controls the space on the top of whatever tag it is used in.
Margin-right;
    Controls the space outside the right side of what tag it is used in.

Text-decoration;
    Creates a decoration for the tag or text its used for, or you can put none for a plain text.
Justify-content;
    Controls how the tag is aligned. EX: center.
Align-Items;
    Controls how the items are aligned as well, EX:center.

Border-Radius;
    Changes the way the border looks on buttons or images.

Opacity;
    Changes how visable or transparent the tag is.

Aspect-Ratio;
    Controls the width/height of a tag.

Box-sixing;
    Controls the width and height even changes padding on a tag as well. 
font-family;
    ensures and fallback system in case the font isnt available.

Min-height;
        makes sure that the tag is never shorter then what you want it to be.

Box-shadow;
    creates a shadow, or highlights. A good designing tool.
Flex-wrap;
    helps control and move things to the next collumn if it gets too large for the containers size.  

flex-direction;
    Controls the direction that the tags are ordered.
border-collapse;
    Controls how the borders are collapsed or even seperated.
z-index;
    Controls if the tags are overlapping anything else on the page, organizies them.

    
    For the css page I did alot of .button or .container(example) for how I labeled things in other pages so that it would effect my styling of specific things once I made them different from the rest, using text-allign, colors, boarders, the hover effect, or something as small as changing the sizing of things. This page did the most for making my website look appealing and making stubborn headers, maps, etc do what they needed to do. Some examples of what I used and why I used them are listed above.
